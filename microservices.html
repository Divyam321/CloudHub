                <h2>What are Microservices?</h2>
                <p>Microservices architecture is a design pattern where an application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over APIs. Each microservice handles a specific function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing for greater flexibility and efficiency.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Improved Scalability: Services can be scaled independently based on demand.</li>
                    <li>Flexibility: Allows the use of different technologies and languages for different services.</li>
                    <li>Resilience: Faults in one service do not impact the entire application.</li>
                    <li>Faster Time-to-Market: Enables parallel development and deployment of services.</li>
